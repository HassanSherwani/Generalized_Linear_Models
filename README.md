# Generalized_Linear_Models

Generalized linear models (GLMs) are an extension of traditional linear models. They have gained popularity in statistical data analysis due to:
 the ﬂexibility of the model structure unifying the typical regression methods (such as linear regression and logistic regression for binary classiﬁcation)
 the recent availability of model-ﬁtting software
 the ability to scale well with large datasets

# Environment
Using library statsmodel in python

# Content 

We shall start with sample OLS model. Then we ll apply 

- GLM: Gamma for proportional count  
- GLM: Binomial

This excercise is a coding practice. Theoratical concepts are discussed very briefly. For detailed theory, I have added .pdf file in repository.

# Modules

Pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodel , seaborn, matplotlib
